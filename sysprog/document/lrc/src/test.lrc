[00:00.00]3 Doors Down - Here By Me
[00:06.21]
[00:08.21]I hope you're doing fine out there without me
[00:16.32]'Cause I'm not doing so good without you
[00:24.54]The things I thought you'd never know about me
[00:32.27]Were the things I guess you always understood
[00:40.46]So how could I have been so blind for all these years
[00:48.91]I guess I only see the truth
[00:52.20]through all this fear of living without you
[00:56.51]
[00:56.84]And everything I have in this world
[01:00.92]And all that I'll ever be
[01:04.66]It could all fall down around me
[01:08.73]Just as long as I have you right here by me
[01:14.16]
[01:21.55]I can't take another day without you
[01:28.77]'Cause, baby, I could never make it on my own
[01:37.68]I've been waiting so long just to hold you
[01:45.24]And to be back in your arms where I belong
[01:53.65]I'm sorry I can't always find the words to say
[02:01.72]Everything I've ever known gets swept away
[02:07.70]Inside of your love
[02:09.60]
[02:10.02]And everything I have in this world
[02:13.88]All that I'll ever be
[02:17.78]It could all fall down around me
[02:21.72]Just as long as I have you right here by me
[02:27.02]
[02:34.59]As the days roll on I see
[02:38.35]Time is standing still for me
[02:42.05]And you're not here
[02:46.44]I'm sorry I can't always find the words to say
[02:54.65]Everything I've ever known gets swept away
[03:00.33]Inside of your love
[03:02.82]

[03:23.06][03:03.09]And everything I have in this world
[03:26.85][03:06.84]And all that i'll ever be
[03:30.39][03:10.37]It could all fall down around me
[03:34.48][03:14.44]Just as long as I have you right here by me
