Accessing members of a vector can be done in constant time, appending elements to a vector can be done in amortized constant time, whereas locating a specific value or inserting elements into the vector takes linear time.
Constructors	create vectors and initialize them with some data
Operators	compare, assign, and access elements of a vector
assign	assign elements to a vector
at	returns an element at a specific location
back	returns a reference to last element of a vector
begin	returns an iterator to the beginning of the vector
capacity	returns the number of elements that the vector can hold
clear	removes all elements from the vector
empty	true if the vector has no elements
end	returns an iterator just past the last element of a vector
erase	removes elements from a vector
front	returns a reference to the first element of a vector
insert	inserts elements into the vector
max_size	returns the maximum number of elements that the vector can hold
pop_back	removes the last element of a vector
push_back	add an element to the end of the vector
rbegin	returns a reverse_iterator to the end of the vector
rend	returns a reverse_iterator to the beginning of the vector
reserve	sets the minimum capacity of the vector
resize	change the size of the vector
size	returns the number of items in the vector
swap	swap the contents of this vector with another
