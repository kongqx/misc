DMA INITIAL SOURCE (DISRC) REGISTER
DMA INITIAL SOURCE CONTROL (DISRCC) REGISTER
DMA INITIAL DESTINATION (DIDST) REGISTER
DMA INITIAL DESTINATION CONTROL (DIDSTC) REGISTER
DMA CONTROL (DCON) REGISTER
DMD_HS [31] Select one between Demand mode and Handshake mode. 0
            0: Demand mode is selected.
            1: Handshake mode is selected.
            In the Handshake mode, DMA controller waits for the deasserted
			DREQ before starting a new transfer. 
                                                                            0
SYNC [30] Select DREQ/DACK synchronization.
          0: DREQ and DACK are synchronized to PCLK (APB clock).
          1: DREQ and DACK are synchronized to HCLK (AHB clock).
          Therefore, for devices attached to AHB system bus, this bit has
          to be set to 1, while for those attached to APB system, it should
          be set to 0. For the devices attached to external systems, the
          user should select this bit depending on which the external
          system is synchronized with between AHB system and APB
          system.

INT [29] Enable/Disable the interrupt setting for CURR_TC (terminal
         count)
TSZ [28] Select the transfer size of an atomic transfer
         (i.e. transfer performed each time DMA owns the bus before
         releasing the bus).

SERVMODE [27] Select the service mode between Single service mode and Whole           0
              service mode.
              0: Single service mode is selected in which after each atomic transfer
              (single or burst of length four) DMA stops and waits for another DMA
              request.
              1: Whole service mode is selected in which one request gets atomic
              transfers to be repeated until the transfer count reaches to 0. In this
              mode, additional request are not required.
HWSRCSEL [26:24] Select DMA request source for each DMA.
                                                                              0
SWHW_SE [23] Select the DMA source between software (S/W request mode) and
L            hardware (H/W request mode).
             0: S/W request mode is selected and DMA is triggered by setting
                SW_TRIG bit of DMASKTRIG control register.
             1: DMA source selected by bit[26:24] triggers the DMA operation.
                                          0
RELOAD [22] Set the reload on/off option.
DSZ [21:20] Data size to be transferred.            00
            00 = Byte                01 = Half word
            10 = Word               11 = reserved
TC [19:0] Initial transfer count (or transfer beat).

DMA STATUS (DSTAT) REGISTER
	STAT: Status of this DMA controller.
	CURR_TC [19:0] Current value of transfer count.
DMA CURRENT SOURCE (DCSRC) REGISTER
CURRENT DESTINATION (DCDST) REGISTER
DMA MASK TRIGGER (DMASKTRIG) REGISTER
	STOP   : Stop the DMA operation.
	ON_OFF : DMA channel on/off bit
	SW_TRIG: Trigger the DMA channel in S/W request mode.
